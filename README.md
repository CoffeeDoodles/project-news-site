# News Site

I created a news site about guinea pigs called the Wheeeeekly News. I wanted a colorful, fun, and responsive site just like my favorite pets. 

## The problem

My biggest problem was the header and understanding media queries and getting my website to properly function with them at breakpoints. 

It seemed no matter what I did the site wouldn't respond to any of the code I was writing. I googled, rewatching tutorials, and eventually talked it out with one of my teammates. My team mate was able to explain media queries to me that triggered a solution in my brain. I realized that I had originally designed my website in desktop view, which is why trying to apply mobile media queries first wasn't working. The heirarchies were all wrong!

I went back and adjusted my css (before media queries) to mobile view and then began applying the queries from there (tablet -> desktop) and it worked! I was able to push forward after that and complete my site.

If I had more time I would like to spend it on the "other-news" section. I am not satisfied with the image sizes and would like to find a more cohesive sizing for them. I would also like to fix some of the growing issues with those containers.
